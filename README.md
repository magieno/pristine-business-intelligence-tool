### Jira
 - Number of issues touched per issue type
 - Averate time spent per issue type

### Pluralsight Flow
 - Number of PRs submitted
 - Number of PRs reviewed
 - Number of robust comments
 - Number of regular comments
 - Number of trivial comments
 - Number of commits per day
 - Coding days per week
